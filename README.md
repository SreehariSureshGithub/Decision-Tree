# Decision-Tree
A decision tree in machine learning is a versatile, interpretable algorithm used for predictive modelling. It structures decisions based on input data, making it suitable for both classification and regression tasks.

A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning to model and predict outcomes based on input data. It is a tree-like structure where each internal node tests on attribute, each branch corresponds to attribute value and each leaf node represents the final decision or prediction. The decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning. They can be used to solve both regression and classification problems.
